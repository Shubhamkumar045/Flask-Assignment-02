    "Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "Answer--GET and POST are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods used in web development\n",
    "to send and receive data between a client (usually a web browser) and a server.\n",
    "GET is used for retrieving data from the server, with data parameters in\n",
    "the URL, making it visible and idempotent.\n",
    "POST is used for submitting data to the server, with data in the request body,\n",
    "making it secure and not idempotent.\n",
    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is primarily used to request data from a specified resource. \n",
    "It is used for retrieving information from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL as query parameters. \n",
    "For example, http://example.com/resource?param1=value1&param2=value2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility: Data sent via a GET request is visible in the URL, making it less secure. \n",
    "It can be seen in browser history, bookmarks, and server logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idempotent: GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning that making the same request\n",
    "multiple times will have the same result as making it once. It should not have any side effects on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching: GET requests are typically cached by browsers, which can improve performance \n",
    "for repeated requests to the same resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Use Cases: Retrieving web pages, fetching data from a server, searching, and \n",
    "navigation within a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "It is often used for actions that modify data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transmission: Data is sent in the request body rather than as part of the URL.\n",
    "This allows for larger data payloads and improved security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility: Data sent via a POST request is not visible in the URL, making it\n",
    "a more secure method for sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Idempotent: POST requests are not considered idempotent, meaning that making the \n",
    "same request multiple times may have different results or cause side effects on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching: POST requests are not typically cached by browsers. They are treated\n",
    "as non-cacheable by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "Answer--In Flask, the request object is used to access and work with incoming HTTP request data,\n",
    "such as form data, query parameters, headers, and more. It allows you to interact with and extract\n",
    "information from the client's request when handling routes and views in your Flask application.\n",
    "The request object is essential for building dynamic web applications and processing user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for the request object in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Form Data: When a user submits a form on a web page, the request object allows\n",
    "you to access the form data submitted by the user. This data can include text input, checkboxes, \n",
    "radio buttons, and other form elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Parameters\n",
    "HTTP Headers\n",
    "Request Method\n",
    "Cookies\n",
    "File Uploads\n",
    "Session Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example--from flask import Flask, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def submit_form():\n",
    "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        username = request.form.get('username')\n",
    "        password = request.form.get('password')\n",
    "        # Process the submitted data (e.g., validate and store)\n",
    "        return f'Username: {username}, Password: {password}'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "Answer--In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform HTTP redirects.\n",
    "It allows you to send an HTTP response to the client that instructs the client's browser\n",
    "to navigate to a different URL. Redirects are commonly used in web applications for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the URL: You can use redirect() to change the URL in the user's browser.\n",
    "For example, after a successful form submission, you might want to redirect the user to a \"thank you\" \n",
    "page or a confirmation page with a different URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Post-Redirect-Get (PRG) Pattern: Redirects are often used to implement the Post-\n",
    "Redirect-Get (PRG) pattern. This pattern is used to prevent form resubmission when a user \n",
    "refreshes a page after submitting a form. After processing a form submission, you redirect\n",
    "the user to a different page using redirect(), preventing the user from accidentally resubmitting\n",
    "the form data when refreshing the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication and Authorization: Redirects are used for authentication and authorization purposes. \n",
    "For example, when an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected resource, the application\n",
    "can redirect them to a login page. After successful authentication, they are redirected back to the\n",
    "originally requested page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning Up URLS: Redirects can help in cleaning up URLs. For instance, you might want to ensure that\n",
    "URLs consistently use lowercase letters, remove trailing slashes, or use a specific naming convention.\n",
    "By implementing redirects, you can enforce these rules for URL consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing Routes: When routes in your application change or are updated, you can use redirects to ensure\n",
    "that users are directed to the new routes without encountering broken links or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example--from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'This is the home page. <a href=\"/redirected\">Click here</a> to redirect.'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/redirected')\n",
    "def redirected():\n",
    "    return 'You have been redirected to this page.'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/redirect')\n",
    "def perform_redirect():\n",
    "    # Redirect the user to the 'redirected' route\n",
    "    return redirect(url_for('redirected'))\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "Answer--n Flask, templates are used to separate the presentation logic (HTML code) from the \n",
    "application logic (Python code). Templates allow you to create dynamic web pages by embedding placeholders,\n",
    "called variables or template expressions, that are filled with data when the page is rendered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why templates are important in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns\n",
    "Dynamic Content\n",
    "Reusable Components\n",
    "Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Example--from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    # Data to be passed to the template\n",
    "    user_name = 'John Doe'\n",
    "    greeting = 'Hello,'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Render the 'home.html' template with the provided data\n",
    "    return render_template('home.html', user_name=user_name, greeting=greeting)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Create a simple API. Use Postman to test it.\n",
    "Answer--Step 1: Set Up Your Flask Application\n",
    "pip install Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a simple Flask application for our API:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
